            Every dog has a story — and we’re here to help you uncover it.  
            <strong>Fur-miliar Finder</strong> is built for dog lovers who’ve ever looked at their pup and wondered,  
            “What breed are you really?”
        </p>

                <h2>How It All Started </h2>
                <p>
                    It began with a curious dog owner and a slightly blurry photo of a rescue dog.  
                    Instead of guessing, we decided to teach a computer to recognize breeds — and that’s how this project was born.  
                    From mutts to majestic purebreds, our system learns to recognize traits that make every dog unique.
                </p>

                <h2>Behind the Code</h2>
                <p>
                    Fur-miliar Finder uses a mix of machine learning, image recognition, and good old-fashioned love for dogs.  
                    Each upload helps the system learn — improving accuracy and helping us identify even the most mysterious breeds.  
                    Think of it as your dog’s very own DNA test, but faster (and way cheaper).
                </p>
